Lesson: Dynamic Prompting

Introduction
Dynamic prompting means adapting the structure of the prompt based on the user’s input or context. Instead of a fixed template, the AI prompt changes depending on what the user describes.

Concept
- Static prompt = fixed wording.
- Dynamic prompt = flexible wording that incorporates context.
- This makes the AI feel smarter and more personalized.

Why it matters for SceneSeeker AI
Since users describe scenes differently (short, vague, or detailed), SceneSeeker AI must adjust:
- If the input is vague → add clarifying questions.
- If the input is detailed → emphasize extracting entities (characters, setting, actions).
- If the input mentions specific actors or quotes → highlight those in the prompt.

Example
User input: "A guy runs really fast with lightning around him."
- Static prompt: "Guess the movie or show."
- Dynamic prompt: "The user described: a guy with super speed and lightning. Suggest movies or TV shows that fit this description."

Benefit
Dynamic prompting makes the guesses more accurate and feels more natural to the user, as the AI adapts to the type of input provided.

Takeaway
By using dynamic prompting, SceneSeeker AI can handle vague, medium, and detailed descriptions without needing separate systems.
