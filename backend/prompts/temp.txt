Lesson: Temperature in AI models

The temperature parameter controls how random or deterministic the model's responses are.

- A lower temperature (close to 0) makes the model more predictable and focused. It always chooses the most likely answer.
- A higher temperature (close to 1 or above) makes the model more creative, generating more diverse outputs.

In SceneSeeker AI:
- If temperature = 0, the model will try to always guess the most likely movie.
- If temperature = 1, the model may explore different guesses or provide more imaginative explanations.

We can adjust this setting depending on whether we want consistent answers or creative brainstorming.
