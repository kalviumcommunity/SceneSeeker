Lesson: Top P (Nucleus Sampling)

Top P controls how many possible words the model considers when generating text.

- Instead of picking from all possible words, the model only chooses from the smallest set of words whose probabilities add up to P.
- For example:
    - Top P = 0.9 means the model considers only the top 90% most likely words.
    - Top P = 1 means the model considers all words.

In SceneSeeker AI:
- A lower Top P makes the guesses more focused.
- A higher Top P allows more varied and unexpected movie guesses.
